# Task Completion Checklist

When completing a task in HQL:

1. **Run Tests**: `deno task test`
2. **Type Check**: `deno check` on modified files
3. **Build**: `make build` to ensure binary builds
4. **Lint**: `deno lint` (optional but recommended)

## Critical Rules
- HQL is its OWN language - never confuse with Clojure
- Refer to `docs/` for HQL syntax reference
