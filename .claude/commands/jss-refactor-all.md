Refactor the current code with these principles:

- **Keep code clean, DRY, and KISS** - Remove all redundancy and repetition
- **Simplify complexity** - Rewrite unnecessarily complex code into simpler versions that do the same thing
- **Optimize algorithms and data structures** - Replace poor implementations with better, faster, proven alternatives that achieve the same result
- **Remove garbage** - Delete unused code, files, scripts, docs, or anything out-of-date, legacy, or dead code that is nowhere used or referenced

**Critical requirement**: Everything must remain fully operational and work exactly the same way. All tests must pass. The refactored code must be logically proven to operate successfully with better, faster, cleaner implementation.
