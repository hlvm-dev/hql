Simplify unnecessarily complex code:

- **Reduce nesting** - Flatten deeply nested conditionals with early returns/guards
- **Clarify logic** - Rewrite convoluted expressions into clear, readable form
- **Split large functions** - Break down functions doing too many things
- **Remove over-engineering** - Strip unnecessary abstractions, configurations, or indirection

**Critical requirement**: Simplified code must produce identical results. All tests must pass. The code should be easier to read and maintain while doing exactly the same thing.
