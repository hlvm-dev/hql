Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles:

- **Eliminate duplication** - Find repeated code blocks and extract into reusable functions
- **Remove redundancy** - Consolidate similar logic, merge near-identical functions
- **Simplify interfaces** - Reduce parameter counts, use sensible defaults
- **Consistent patterns** - Ensure similar operations use the same approach throughout

**Critical requirement**: Refactored code must behave exactly the same. All tests must pass. No functional changes - only structural improvements.
